;To get command line parameters in assembly code, you can access them through the stack. 
;Here's an example of how you can modify the given code to retrieve command line parameters:

;```assembly
section .data
    hello db 'This is a test message, will be using this for more assembly programs.',0

section .text
    global _start

extern _printf
extern _exit

_start:
    ; Get the command line arguments
    mov ebx, [esp+4] ; Get the address of the first argument
    add ebx, 4 ; Skip the program name

    ; Call printf to display the string
    push ebx ; Pass the address of the first argument to printf
    call _printf
    add esp, 4

    ; Exit the program
    xor eax, eax
    call _exit
;```

;In this modified code, we access the command line arguments by accessing the stack. 
;The first argument is located at `[esp+4]`, and we skip the program name by adding 4 to the address. 
;We then pass the address of the first argument to `printf` to display it.
;Note that the specific implementation may vary depending on the assembly language and platform you are using.
